1. <b> tag
The <b> HTML element is used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not
otherwise granted special importance. This was formerly known as the Boldface element, and most
browsers still draw the text in boldface.
2.<i> tag
The <i> HTML element represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason,
such as idiomatic text, technical terms, taxonomical designations, among others. Historically, these have
been presented using italicized type, which is the original source of the <i> naming of this element.
3.<u> tag
The <u> HTML element represents a span of inline text which should be rendered in a way that indicates
that it has a non-textual annotation. This is rendered by default as a simple solid underline, but may be
altered using CSS.
4.<select> tag
The <select> HTML element represents a control that provides a menu of options.
5.<button> tag
The <button> HTML element is an interactive element activated by a user with a mouse, keyboard,
finger, voice command, or other assistive technology. Once activated, it then performs a programmable
action.
6.<hr> tag
The <hr> HTML element represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements: for example, a
change of scene in a story, or a shift of topic within a section.
7.<br> tag
The <br> HTML element produces a line break in text (carriage-return). It is useful for writing a poem or
an address, where the division of lines is significant.
